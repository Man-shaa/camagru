# Camagru

Camagru is a full-stack web application that allows users to capture or upload photos, apply overlay images (such as stickers or frames), and share them publicly. Users can comment on and like shared images. The project emphasizes user authentication, image processing, and secure web practices, and serves as an introduction to real-world web development.

## üß† Project Goal

The primary objective of Camagru is to develop a complete web application from scratch, focusing on:

- Frontend and backend integration
- Image processing and compositing
- User authentication and security
- Database interaction and session management
- Containerized deployment with `docker-compose`

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Tools

### Languages
- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (Vanilla, no JS frameworks)
- **Backend:** PHP (Standard Library only)
- **Database:** MySQL (or MariaDB)
- **Image Processing:** GD or Imagick (PHP libraries)

### Tools
- Docker / Docker Compose
- Apache or Nginx (or PHP built-in webserver)
- Mail server or external SMTP for notifications
- Git

### Framework Restrictions
- ‚úÖ CSS frameworks allowed (as long as they don‚Äôt include forbidden JS)
- ‚ùå JS frameworks (React, Vue, jQuery, etc.) not allowed
- ‚ùå External server-side libraries without a native PHP equivalent

## üß∑ Security Considerations

- Passwords must be hashed (e.g. with `password_hash`)
- CSRF protection for form submissions
- Proper input sanitization and validation
- Server-side restrictions for image ownership and actions
- No client-stored or hardcoded credentials
- All credentials and sensitive data should be placed in a `.env` file (excluded from Git)

---

## üß™ Deployment

The project must support deployment using containers. A `docker-compose.yml` file is required for setting up:

- Web server (Apache/Nginx)
- PHP backend
- Database service

With a single command, the full environment should be launchable.

```bash
docker-compose up --build
