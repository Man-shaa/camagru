# Camagru

Camagru is a full-stack web application that allows users to capture or upload photos, apply overlay images (such as stickers or frames), and share them publicly. Users can comment on and like shared images. The project emphasizes user authentication, image processing, and secure web practices, and serves as an introduction to real-world web development.

## üß† Project Goal

The primary objective of Camagru is to develop a complete web application from scratch, focusing on:

- Frontend and backend integration
- Image processing and compositing
- User authentication and security
- Database interaction and session management
